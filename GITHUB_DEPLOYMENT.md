## Daily Deployment Workflow

Whenever updates are made to HTML, CSS, assets, or director portfolios in `website/`:

```bash
cd /Users/jacksonmcmurdo/Desktop/Pylon/website
git add .
git commit -m "Update portfolio reels and crew credits"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Pages will automatically build and publish changes to `https://bypylon.com` within 30-45 seconds.

## Local Staging for Preview

To preview the website locally before committing or during meetings without publishing to production:

```bash
cd /Users/jacksonmcmurdo/Desktop/Pylon/website
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in any browser.
